/**
 * The public marketing site.
 *
 * Section order follows the reference; the colour does not. The reference ran
 * terracotta → cream → cream → sand → cream → ivory → terracotta, which is one
 * hue doing almost all the work and is why the page read as monotonous below
 * the fold. Here each section takes a distinct ground — terracotta, cream,
 * ivory, **sage**, sand, ivory, terracotta, cream — and the gold/coral gradient
 * stays reserved for the two moments that actually matter, the primary buttons.
 *
 * The joins between sections are textile edges drawn from the eight Northeast
 * states (see `components/ner/`), and scrolling is smoothed by Lenis, mounted
 * once for the whole app in `main.tsx` — which is also what makes the `#how`
 * and `#features` anchor links glide.
